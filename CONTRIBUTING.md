Sending a Pull Request
======================

Use the following checklist to make sure your pull request can be reviewed and merged as efficiently as possible:

- If you are sending the PR for code review only and *not* for merge, add the "[WIP]" prefix to the PR's title.
- Write a descriptive Pull Request description (See sample below). Ideally, it should communicate:
    - Purpose
    	- The overall philosophy behind the changes you've made, so that, if there are questions as to whether an implementation detail was appropriate, this can be consulted before talking with the developer.
    	- Which Github issue the PR addresses, if applicable.
    - Changes. 
    	- The details of the implementation as you intended them to be. If you did front-end changes, add screenshots here.
    - Side effects. 
    	- Potential concerns, esp. regarding security, privacy, and provenance, which will requires extra care during review.
